# Postarr
ðŸŽ¬ Postarr: (Partially)Automate your movie poster collection! Postarr is a Flask app that scrapes movie directories and downloads high-quality posters from TheMovieDB. Designed for seamless integration with Docker on Synology NAS. Optional Slack integration for instant notifications!

Welcome to Postarr, a Flask-based application designed to automatically scrape your movie directories and download high-quality posters from TheMovieDB (TMDb). Whether youâ€™re managing a vast movie collection on your Synology NAS or simply want to keep your movie library visually appealing, Postarr is here to help. Additionally, you can opt-in for Slack notifications to get instant updates when new posters are added!

## Features

	â€¢ 	Automated Poster Downloading: Automatically fetch posters from TMDb based on your movie directory.
	â€¢	Multi-Directory Support: Seamlessly manage multiple movie directories.
	â€¢	Slack Integration (Optional): Get notified instantly in your Slack channel when a poster is downloaded.
	â€¢	Docker Compatible: Built with Docker in mind, especially for Synology NAS.
  	â€¢	Movie Collection Dashboard: View all movies in your collection, displayed with their corresponding posters.
	â€¢ 	Search Functionality: Search for movies directly from TMDb based on user input.
 	â€¢ 	Poster Update Select from multiple available posters and update missing or low-resolution posters for your movies.
	â€¢	Smooth Scrolling with Anchors**: Automatically scroll to the selected movie in the movie list after a poster update.

## Prerequisites

	â€¢	Docker installed on your system.
	â€¢	A Synology NAS or any system capable of running Docker containers.
	â€¢	A valid TMDb API key.
 	â€¢	If you have existing poster.ext in your movie folders, then you will want to use my side project: postarr-thumbnail-creator in order to automatically create poster-thumb.jpg of the existing files. This was done to speed up load time on librarys with large amount of movies. 
	â€¢	(Optional) Slack webhook URL for notifications.
 **IMPORTANT NOTE**: Unless you use my [poster-thumbnail script](https://github.com/anthonysnyder/postarr-thumbnail-creator/tree/main "poster-thumbnail script") in order to create thumbnails, this app will **NOT** display any thumbnails. This was done in order to severely reduce load times on large libraries.
