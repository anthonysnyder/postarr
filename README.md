# Postarr
ðŸŽ¥ **Postarr**: (Partially) Automate your movie and TV show poster collection! Postarr is a Flask app that scrapes directories and downloads high-quality posters for your **movies** and **TV shows** from TheMovieDB (TMDb). Designed for seamless integration with Docker or Synology NAS. Optional Slack integration for instant notifications!

Welcome to **Postarr**, a Flask-based application designed to keep your movie and TV show libraries visually appealing by automatically downloading high-quality posters. Whether managing a vast collection on your Synology NAS or organizing a smaller local library, Postarr is here to help. With support for movies and now TV shows, you can streamline poster management across all your media. Additionally, you can opt-in for Slack notifications to get instant updates when new posters are added!

## Features

	â€¢	Automated Poster Downloading: Automatically fetch posters for movies and TV shows from TMDb based on your directory structure.
	â€¢	Multi-Directory Support: Seamlessly manage multiple directories for both movies and TV shows.
	â€¢	Slack Integration (Optional): Get notified instantly in your Slack channel when a poster is downloaded.
	â€¢	Docker Compatible: Built with Docker in mind, especially for Synology NAS setups.
	â€¢	Media Collection Dashboard: View all movies and TV shows in your collection with their corresponding posters.
	â€¢	Search Functionality: Search for movies and TV shows directly from TMDb based on user input.
	â€¢	Poster Update: Select and update missing or low-resolution posters for your movies or TV shows.
	â€¢	Smooth Scrolling with Anchors: Automatically scroll to the selected media in the list after a poster is updated.

## Prerequisites

	â€¢	Docker installed on your system.
	â€¢	A Synology NAS or any system capable of running Docker containers.
	â€¢	A valid TMDb API key.
 	â€¢	If you have existing poster.ext in your movie folders, then you will want to use my side project: postarr-thumbnail-creator in order to automatically create poster-thumb.jpg of the existing files. This was done to speed up load time on librarys with large amount of movies. 
	â€¢	(Optional) Slack webhook URL for notifications.
 **IMPORTANT NOTE**: Unless you use my [poster-thumbnail script](https://github.com/anthonysnyder/postarr-thumbnail-creator/tree/main "poster-thumbnail script") in order to create thumbnails, this app will **NOT** display any thumbnails. This was done in order to severely reduce load times on large libraries.
